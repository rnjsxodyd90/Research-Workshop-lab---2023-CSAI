This code is part of a research project focused on understanding the effects of Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on personality traits, specifically those identified by the Big Five personality model: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness. The project aims to analyze the relationship between these personality traits and changes in brain wave patterns before and after DMT exposure, using machine learning models for prediction and analysis.

This project investigates the potential of using Electroencephalogram (EEG) data to predict the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) and examines how the administration of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a powerful psychedelic compound, affects the performance of machine learning models in this predictive task. Utilizing the Spanish version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) and EEG data from 28 experienced participants, we explore the capability of three machine learning models—Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), and Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR)—to make accurate personality predictions. Our findings reveal that while models could predict Neuroticism with some consistency before DMT application, their performance declined post-DMT. Agreeableness was somewhat successfully predicted by one model, but again, not after DMT use. Predictions for Openness were ambiguous, with two models showing deteriorated performance after DMT. No models effectively predicted Extraversion and Conscientiousness, regardless of DMT application. This study contributes to the limited research on the impact of psychedelics on EEG-based personality prediction, suggesting that EEG may not reliably predict BFI traits with or without DMT influence
