This code is part of a research project focused on understanding the effects of Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on personality traits, specifically those identified by the Big Five personality model: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness. The project aims to analyze the relationship between these personality traits and changes in brain wave patterns before and after DMT exposure, using machine learning models for prediction and analysis.

Project title: Identifying Big Five personality traits from electroencephalogram (EEG) data while checking for N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) influence.
